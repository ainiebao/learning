&emsp;Recently, I am learning English writing, so I take part in a writing course *How to Write an Essay* on [Edx](https://courses.edx.org). My goal is to finish this course in two weeks. I am doing the first week tasks, and I can complete them before tomorrow. I will display some my writing answers below.

## 2020-11-05 Week 1
### Freewriting(optional exercise)
>Freewriting topic 1: What is your biggest problem in writing in English? How do you think you can improve your writing?

#### My answer
##### What is your biggest problem in writing in English?
&emsp;Every writer has porblems about writing, including those who are really good at writing but my problems are so many.
&emsp;First, I can't use many words precisely. For example, when I recite the word *grass*, I want to use it to make a sentence, but I don't know whether it is a contable noun or a uncaoutable noun or a varieable noun, so I have to look it up on the website [Collis](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/).
&emsp;Second, grammar can sometimes become a problem, but my grammar are ok, so this can't bother me.
&emsp; Now you can see my biggest shortcome in writing in English is 
English vocabulary and phrase. 

### 2020-11-06 11:50 am Week 2
&emsp; I start to study the week 2 of the course. I will past some useful courseware here.
>The word **paragraph** comes from the Greek word *paragraphos *("to write beside" or "written beside"). The paragraph is a unit of writing expressing one specific idea, and is made up of one or more sentences.
In this course, we are going to focus on **academic writing**. In this type of writing, paragraphs often have three parts: a topic sentence, one or more body sentences supporting the topic sentence, and a concluding sentence that transitions to the next paragraph (or ends the essay).
Look at these two paragraphs. Can you tell which paragraph is an example of academic writing?

>1.  Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.(Source: [University of North Carolina Writing Center Opens in new window](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/paragraphs/))

>2.  A team of archaeologists said Monday it has unearthed an unusual coffin-within-a-coffin in the central England parking lot where it found the skeleton of King Richard III, and that they hope to identify the remains within.(Source: [Science Daily Opens in new window](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130728221522.htm))
You probably guessed that the first paragraph is the academic one. Can you identify the topic sentence and supporting sentences?
The second paragraph is typical of journalistic writing--that is, writing found in newspapers. It often relies on short paragraphs to tell important pieces of information.

#### How can we develop our paragraph?
>In academic essay writing, a good paragraph is organized so that makes sense to the reader. Each sentence leads logically to the next, and is connected through transition words or other connecting words. In addition to a topic sentence and a main idea, an effective paragraph is coherent and develops its idea.
Coherence
Coherence  makes a paragraph understandable to a reader. You can help create coherence in your paragraphs by using logical and verbal connections. You can develop logical connections by making sure that each sentence in a paragraph relates in some way to the topic sentence. You can also create these connections through the use of words ("verbal connections"). For example, you can:
1.Repeat key words
2.Use synonyms for key words
3.Use pronouns to link sentences together
4.Link sentences with transition words 
Development
Development refers to the support you have for your topic sentence. A well-developed paragraph should have an adequate number of sentences to support the main idea. What's an "adequate number"? That depends on the idea, and how much development it needs. Here are some ways you can make sure your paragraphs are developed. You can:
1.Use examples 
2.Give data (for example, statistics, data, information, examples)
3.Quote others, either directly or through paraphrasing
4.Tell a story
5.Define your key words
6.Compare or contrast ideas
7.Examine causes and effects
Of course, there are other ways to do this. Can you think of others?
